## [0.0.10]

### Changed

- Moved _Angular Console_ extension to the recommended section because the extension causes an error and prevents our extension from working properly. People have already submitted the Issue ([ISSUE I](https://github.com/nrwl/angular-console/issues/718) and [ISSUE II](https://github.com/nrwl/angular-console/issues/741)) but apparently the developer cannot reproduce the bugs and closes the issues.

### Fixed

- Replaced SASS extension maintained by _robinbently_ with the new Version that is maintained by [_TheRealSyler_](https://github.com/TheRealSyler/vscode-sass-indented) (syler.sass-indented).
- Update npm dependencies (fix GitHub issued vulnerabilities)

## [0.0.8]

### Changed

- Extension for improved _Sass_ syntax highlighting
- _Night Owl_ theme, _VS Live Share_, _ngrx for Angular 2_, and _Angular Snippets_ as recommended extension
